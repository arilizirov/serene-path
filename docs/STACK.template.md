# STACK.md — current decisions (the freshness layer)

The brains carry *timeless judgment* (when distribution earns its cost, how to
migrate a contract safely). That judgment doesn't expire. **Current practice**
does — which library, which version, today's idiom. This file holds the
current, project-specific decisions so the agent meets durable principles with
present-day facts.

Keep it short and current. When a choice here goes stale, fix it here. For
anything genuinely time-sensitive (a library's exact current API, whether
something is deprecated), the agent should **fetch live docs at task time**
rather than trust any frozen text — this file or a book.

> SUPERVISION: doc-fetching is a tool an agent can misuse — wrong source,
> outdated cache, hallucinated API. The agent must NAME what it fetched (URL +
> what it concluded) in its reply so a human can sanity-check it. Treat fetched
> facts as proposals to verify, not ground truth.
